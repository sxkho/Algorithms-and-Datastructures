# Algorithms-and-Datastructures
Course given in algorithms and datastructures at KTH, the Royal Institute of Technology. The course covers basic algorithm analysis, fundamental
algorithms such as search and sorting algorithms, fundamental data structures such as trees and heaps, and also problem design. In this course, 
one has a choice of language, and my choice was Java.
